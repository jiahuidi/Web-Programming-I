        <h2>Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</h2>
        <p><em>Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</em> was the place where I got my Bachlor degree. I studied in this university for four years and I really enjoyed my time there. <strong>Software Engineering</strong> was my favorite course there. Prof. Xiao was a very good engineer and I learnt a lot from him. I've been the director of Entertainment Department in the Student Union for two years. It was really memorable to work with my friends and hold the parties.</p>

        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>I'm a graduate student in <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/" title="SIT Home Page"><em>Stevens Institute of Technology</em></a> and major in Computer Science. I'll get my Master degree here next year. I attended the course Introduction to JAVA programming last semester. Since I haven't learnt JAVA before, this course was really useful for me to getting start. I went to a party held by Indian students on Halloween with my friends last semester. It was really an interesting party and we even made our own pumpkin carving.</p>
